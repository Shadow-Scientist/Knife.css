# Knife.css
Let's cut them down!

Knife.css is a simple typography cut-out library to cut and slice text specially words. It's a css project, just for fun :)
Despite of being a fun project, Knife.css has a wide range of uses and ready to implement in any project. Here are some of them:

<ul>
  <li>Cool typography logo reveal effect</li>
  <li>Text hover effect (assume something to deny)</li>
  <li>Instructable tables</li>
  <li>CSS Slide animations</li>
</ul>

I'll provide demos of them soon.

<h1>How to use it?</h1>
Simply download the package and add the <link> inside <head> tag.
  
<code>
  <HEAD>
  <link href="knife-2.43.322.stable.css" rel="stylesheet">
  </HEAD>
</code>
