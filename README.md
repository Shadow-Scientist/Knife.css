# Knife.css
Let's cut them down!

Knife.css is a simple typography cut-out library to cut and slice text, specially words. It's a css project, just for fun :)<br>
Despite of being a fun project, Knife.css has a wide range of uses and ready to implement in any project. Here are some of them:

- Cool typography logo reveal effect
- Text hover effect (assume something to deny)
- Instructable tables
- CSS Slide animations

## How to use it?
Simply download the package and add knife.css file into the &lt;head&gt; tag of your site.<BR>
```<link href="knife-1.0.stable.css" rel="stylesheet">```

Add this onliner where you want to see your typography. Change the ```text``` attribute with the word you want to see.<BR>
```<div class="knife" text="TEXT-GOES-HERE"><div></div></div>```

It's that simple!
