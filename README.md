# Knife.css
Let's cut them down!

Knife.css is a simple typography cut-out library to cut and slice text, specially words. It's a css project, just for fun :)<br>
Despite of being a fun project, Knife.css has a wide range of uses and ready to implement in any project. Here are some of them:

- Cool typography logo reveal effect
- Text hover effect (assume something to deny)
- Instructable tables
- CSS Slide animations

I'll provide demos of them soon.

## How to use it?
Simply download the package and add knife.css file into the &lt;head&gt; tag of your site.<BR>
```<link href="knife-1.0.stable.css" rel="stylesheet">```

Add this onliner where you want to see your typography. Change the ```text``` attribute with the word you want to see.<BR>
```<div class="knife" text="TEXT-GOES-HERE"><div></div></div>```

It's that simple!

## Coming up next in v2.0
Knife.css v2 is coming soon with some extended features and uses including icon spliting and sword cut effect
You can also add an extra ```-knife-class``` for another spliting effect. Possible classes are\-
- **-knife-diag**: Diagonally split the specified text.
- **-knife-fade**: Split the specified text and fade out both splices.
- **-knife-sword**: Cut out the text with a sword effect and fade out the knife.
- **-knife-icon**: Split icon instead of text. Use ```--icon``` style attribute for specifiying an icon. Required "Material Desgin Icons" from https://github.com/Templarian/MaterialDesign or specify your own icon font.<BR>
```.knife{font-family: "Icon Font"}```
  
\* You can use **-knife-diag**, **-knife-fade** and **-knife-sword** with **-knife-icon**

I'll try to update this readme soon. :)
