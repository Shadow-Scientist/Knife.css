# Knife.css
Let's cut them down!

Knife.css is a simple typography cut-out library to cut and slice text, specially words. It's a css project, just for fun :)<br>
Despite of being a fun project, Knife.css has a wide range of uses and ready to implement in any project. Here are some of them:

<ul>
  <li>Cool typography logo reveal effect</li>
  <li>Text hover effect (assume something to deny)</li>
  <li>Instructable tables</li>
  <li>CSS Slide animations</li>
</ul>

I'll provide demos of them soon.

<h2>How to use it?</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type:none">
<li>Simply download the package and add knife.css file into the &lt;head&gt; tag of your site.</li>
<li><code>&lt;link href="knife-2.43.322.stable.css" rel="stylesheet"&gt;</code></li>
<li>Add this onliner where you want to see your typography. Change the <code>text</code> attribute with the word you want to see.</li>
<li><code>&lt;div class="knife" text="TEXT">&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code></li>
<li>It's that simple!</li>
<ol>
